🧾 Problem Statement

Electric Vehicle (EV) users often face range anxiety — uncertainty about how far their vehicle can travel before requiring a recharge.
Existing navigation and energy estimation systems provide only basic, static predictions, failing to consider real-world factors such as driving behavior, terrain, temperature, traffic, and weather conditions.

Additionally, EV drivers lack an intelligent assistant that can:

Explain these range predictions

Suggest energy-efficient driving tips

Plan optimal routes with charging stops

This limits the overall driving experience and reduces trust in EV technology.

Therefore, there is a strong need for a software-based intelligent system that combines:

🧠 Machine Learning for accurate range prediction

💬 Generative AI (GPT) for interactive communication, report generation, and smart route guidance
